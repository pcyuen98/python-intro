# Objective
This module to practice 
1. The basic usages of a class, function and objects. 
2. Focus in structured programming and static function usages
3. Limited usages of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) to instantiation, data attributes and method class

exclusion: Data abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism in intermediate module

# Why function is important
1. Functions Make task more structure and it's very basic programming concept
2. Functions Make Testing and Debugging Easier
3. Functions Let You Reuse Code

# Structured (Function file) vs Object Oriented (Object File) Programming
