# Objective
This module to practice the basic usages of a class, function and objects. 

# Why function is important
1. Functions Make task more structure and it's very basic programming concept
2. Functions Make Testing and Debugging Easier
3. Functions Let You Reuse Code

# Structure (Function file) vs Object Oriented (Object File) Programming
